# 👋 Welcome To My Data Analyst Portfolio

I came to the U.S. with broken English and a deadline to learn fast. Data became my second language.  
Today I build reliable SQL/Python pipelines, Power BI dashboards with DAX, and ML prototypes that answer business questions. I share the systems behind my work on LinkedIn as **Analyst Vault**—simple frameworks, clean visuals, and honest lessons from the trenches.  
Below are the projects I'm proud of—**each one ships insight, not just charts.**
